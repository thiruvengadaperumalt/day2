What are Document and Window Objects?
Before delving into the differences, let's define what Document and Window objects are:

Document Object:
The Document object represents the web page itself. It is an integral part of the Document Object Model (DOM) and serves as an interface to
  interact with the content and structure of a web page. The Document object allows you to access and manipulate HTML elements, change their
  properties, and update the content dynamically.

Window Object:
The Window object represents the browser window or tab in which a web page is loaded. It provides access to various properties, methods, and 
  events related to the browser window, such as controlling navigation, handling pop-up dialogs, and managing the global scope for JavaScript.

Key Differences:
Now, let's explore the primary differences between Document and Window objects:

1. Scope:
Document Object: The Document object has a limited scope. It pertains specifically to the content within a single web page. You can access 
and manipulate elements, their properties, and attributes using the Document object, but it doesn't provide control over the broader browser window.

Window Object: The Window object, on the other hand, has a global scope. It encompasses the entire browser window or tab and controls various
aspects of the browser, including navigation, history, and the global JavaScript environment.

2. Content Manipulation:
Document Object: The Document object is primarily used to interact with the content and structure of the web page. You can use it to select 
and modify HTML elements, change their attributes, add or remove elements, and manipulate the page's content dynamically.

Window Object: While the Window object doesn't directly manipulate HTML content, it plays a crucial role in opening new browser windows or tabs, controlling
their properties, and managing pop-up dialogs. It also handles events related to the browser window's state.

3. Hierarchy:
Document Object: The Document object is part of the DOM hierarchy and is nested within the Window object. It represents the structure of a single 
web page within the browser window.

Window Object: The Window object is at the top of the hierarchy and represents the entire browser window or tab. It encapsulates one or more
Document objects, each corresponding to a loaded web page.

Use Cases:
Understanding when to use Document or Window objects is vital for effective web development:

Use the Document object when you need to interact with and manipulate the content and structure of a specific web page.

Utilize the Window object when you need to control browser behavior, manage global variables, handle pop-up windows, or control the browser's navigation.

In conclusion, Document and Window objects are fundamental concepts in web development and JavaScript. While they share some 
similarities and overlap in functionality, they serve distinct purposes. The Document object deals with the content and structure of a web page, while
the Window object manages the broader browser window, including navigation and global JavaScript scope. Understanding these differences is crucial
for building interactive and dynamic web applications effectively.
